# Using the assistant OCS API

The assistant OCS API allows you to run/schedule tasks, get the task history, manage tasks etc...

This API is documented with OpenAPI. You can view it with the [ocs_api_viewer app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocs_api_viewer):
* install the ocs_api_viewer app
* install the assistant
* browse the ocs_api_viewer app
* select "assistant" in the left sidebar

For the moment we have different endpoints for Text Processing, Speech to text and Image generation.
This will be unified in the near future so there might be breaking changes to this API.
